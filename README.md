# Emotion Detection in Hebrew Texts using HeBERT

This project is part of the final assignment for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course at [Your University Name].  
It focuses on emotion classification in Hebrew, leveraging the `avichr/heBERT` model with fine-tuning for our custom dataset.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To train a Hebrew emotion classifier that can categorize sentences into one of six emotions:  
**joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, surprise**

The model is fine-tuned on a translated version of the [Kaggle Emotion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions), originally in English, and preprocessed into Hebrew for domain alignment.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

- Python
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Google Colab
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 📊 Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Translated original dataset to Hebrew using Google Translate API.
- Encoded labels with `LabelEncoder`.
- Tokenized the text with `HeBERT tokenizer`.

### 2. Model Training
We fine-tuned the `avichr/heBERT` model on CPU using PyTorch (manual training loop).  
Training was performed over **3 epochs** with a batch size of 16.

### 3. Inference
After training, we evaluated the model on example inputs and visualized prediction accuracy.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
We computed the following metrics on the test set:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
